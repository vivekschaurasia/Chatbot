## Introduction:

This Chatbot is implemented in TensorFlow. Seq2Seq model is used to predict the sentence. The chatbot is trained on Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus. The main features of this model are LSTM cells, a bidirectional dynamic RNN, and decoders with attention mechanism. 


## Dataset:

The dataset is referred from Cornell.

The chatbot is wriiten in python language in a colab notebook environment. 


## List of Hyperparameters:

Parameters: batch_size, embedding size, Learning _rate, epochs, Keep_probability, learning_rate_decay


## Accuracy:

After training 200 epoch, we can get a pretty good accuracy on test dataset.
